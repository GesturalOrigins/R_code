###Code for Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure with Double Semi Partailing: linear regression model formula for matrix data###

mrqap.dsp(formula, intercept = TRUE, directed = "undirected",
          diagonal = FALSE, test.statistic = "t-value", 
          tol = 1e-07, randomisations = 1000)
         
####example: does matrix B predict matrix A?
#intercept = TRUE: yes we are calculating the intercept 
#directed="undirected" : the networks of matrices are undirected
#diagonal = FALSE: not including left-loop values (e.g. association value of individual aXa) 
#test.statistic = "t-value": use t-statistics to calculate p-value
#tol=1e-07: the tolerance value for the qr function
#randomisations = 1000: number of randomisations performed to calculate p-value

mrqap.dsp(A~B, intercept = TRUE, directed = "undirected",
          diagonal = FALSE, test.statistic = "t-value", 
          tol = 1e-07, randomisations = 1000)
